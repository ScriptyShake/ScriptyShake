### Hi there 👋 

- 🐧 I worked on the games [Sounds of Shadows](https://buas.itch.io/sounds-of-shadows), [Snopuck](https://scriptyshake.itch.io/snopuck-team-butterfly-2223-y1d) & made sprites for the mod [Katana FIFTEEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VHlKWVgQAk).
- 🤖 I primarily code in Houdini VEX, C++, GLSL/HLSL & Python. I use Unreal Engine 5 & custom engines!
- 🔭 I stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptyshake) & make videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFCmJbqXMYAt6lFoi3Zr1Gw) sometimes.
- ⚡ You can play my games on [itch.io](https://scriptyshake.itch.io/) & this is my [Portfolio](https://www.artstation.com/scriptyshake).
