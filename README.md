### Hi there 👋 

- 🐧 I worked on the game [Snopuck](https://scriptyshake.itch.io/snopuck-team-butterfly-2223-y1d) & made sprites for the mod [Katana FIFTEEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VHlKWVgQAk).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on [TelekineSIX](https://github.com/ScriptyShake/TelekineSIX) & a Katana ZERO fan-game.
- 🤖 I primarily code in C++, C# & Python. I have experience in Unreal Engine 5 & Unity, as well as OpenGL.
- 🔭 I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scriptyshake) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/scriptyshake/) & [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFCmJbqXMYAt6lFoi3Zr1Gw).
- ⚡ This is my [Portfolio](https://valentinamalavasi.myportfolio.com/) & you can play my games on [itch.io](https://scriptyshake.itch.io/).
- 💬 I like worldbuilding and creating characters and stories. I also like to write and do art in my free time!
- 😄 Fun fact: I love TTRPGs and play D&D!

(I mostly use Perforce so my GitHub activity might be a little inconsistent)
