### Hi there 👋 
### I'm Valentina Malavasi, a 2nd Year Game Programming Student at Breda University of Applied Sciences!

I am currently interested in learning about gameplay & AI, as well as graphics, tech art and proceduralism!   

Some of my favorite games that have been a great source of inspiration to me are: Katana ZERO, Undertale, Celeste, Ori, Subnautica, Genshin Impact, Hi-Fi Rush, & Skyrim.  

- 🐧 I worked on the game [Snopuck](https://scriptyshake.itch.io/snopuck-team-butterfly-2223-y1d) & made sprites for the mod [Katana FIFTEEN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VHlKWVgQAk).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on [TelekineSIX](https://github.com/ScriptyShake/TelekineSIX) & a Katana ZERO fan-game.
- 🔭 I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scriptyshake) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/scriptyshake/) & [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFCmJbqXMYAt6lFoi3Zr1Gw).

- 💬 I like worldbuilding and creating characters and stories. I also like to write and do art in my free time!
- 😄 Fun fact: I love TTRPGs and play D&D!
